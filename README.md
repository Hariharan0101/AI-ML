# Colouring-nodes-AI-ML-

Given a graph G with V nodes and E edges, the task is to colour no more than floor(V/2) nodes such that every node has at least one coloured node at a distance of atmost 1 unit. The distance between any two connected nodes of the graph is always exactly 1 unit. Print the nodes that need to be colored.
